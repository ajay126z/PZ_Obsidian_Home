# OKRs ðŸŽ¯
- Objective and Key Results
- This is a very popular framework in the corporate world for aligning personal, team, and overall company goals. After hearing so much about OKR in the companies I worked for I ended up adopting it and using it for personal projects too.

- How to use this framework:
   Usually, I set goals based on quarters, so in the title, I put the dates in which this is valid. I write the goal I want to achieve along with the metrics that show the progress of each key result. Occasionally I update these numbers and make sure I am going in the direction I want to go.
## Start date -> Complete date

- Objective: Where do I want to go? How do I get there?
