  template:: FearSetting
  collapsed:: true
	- Easy Choices, hard life. Hard Choices, easy life. - Jerzy Gregorek
	- What is fear setting?
		- It’s similar to goal setting. This is a three step exercise to define your fears and explore things you can do - or not do - to help you overcome them. Understanding fears lets you make difficult choices, and difficult choices lead to peace and happiness.
	- History
		- Fear setting was developed by Tim Ferris as “The most valuable exercise I do Every Month” and presented in his famous TED talk which gathered more than 5 millions views.
	- The Process
		- Focus on one of your fears and walk through three steps.
		- 1. Define. What are the worst things that can happen?
		- 2. Prevent. How can I prevent them from happening?
		- 3. Repair. If the worst did happen, how could I fix it or minimize the impact?
	- Fear setting can help you make hard decisions. Such decisions can be substantial:
		- Should I proceed with a risky invasive surgery?
		- Should I talk to my loved ones about how I want to spend the remainder of my life?
		- Should I be honest with others about what really matters to me?
		- Should I quit my job and pursue things I have always dreamed about doing - such as spending more time with my family?
-

		- History
			- This exercise dates back many thousand of years. It was used by the Stoic philosophers Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, and Seneca.
		- Potential Benefits
			- Negative visualization build gratefulness. It helps you teach yourself how lucky you are and that you should be grateful for everything in your life - no matter where you find yourself.
			- You will grow in contentment, learning to better appreciate the things you already have and realize you should be thankful for them.
			- Ultimately, you will better understand possible outcomes in your life, and become more honest with yourself.
			- If you suffer from depression, anxiety or panic attacks - be careful. This exercise may make you feel uncomfortable. Listen to your body and skip or pick other exercise if you feel discomfort.
		- Process
			- Step 1.
				- Imagine that something bad has happened to you:
					- You’ve lost your home and job
					- You’ve lost your family
					- You’ve lost an important ability like your sight or the ability to talk or walk (or, imagine that you were born without such an)
					- You were born in a lower class family
			- Step 2.
				- Try to imagine a disaster happening at this very moment.
				- Try to picture the worst case scenario: List everything that could possibly go wrong.
				- Imagine that the plane or public train that you or your loved one is on breaks down and crashes.
			- Step 3.
				- Think about how lucky you are to be alive right now. List the ways that you are - specifically- fortunate to be in the very place you are, right now.
				- Contrast this with the work you just did in picturing how much worse it could be.
				- Write about the people, decisions, events, and things you are grateful for.
