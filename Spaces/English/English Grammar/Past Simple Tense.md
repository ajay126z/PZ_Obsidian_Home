## What is Past Simple Tense ?
- The Past Simple tense, also known as the Simple Past tense, is a verb tense used to describe completed actions or events that occurred in the past and have no connection to the present. In English, regular verbs typically form the Past Simple tense by adding "-ed" to the base form of the verb (e.g., "walked," "talked"). Irregular verbs, however, have unique past tense forms (e.g., "went," "ate"). 
## Example
-  "She walked to the store" (regular verb) and "He went on vacation" (irregular verb).
