## Thoughts on Journaling

Just now one thought came into my mind, I think journalism and journalists who works in news are the persons from whom I can learn on how to structure thoughts and prepare an article. If possible I would like to understand Journalism course from online videos. 

Anyway, Journaling is a vast field, so let’s see how this ride goes from now onwards.

In the startling phase, I would like to build habit of 5 minutes journaling. I will journal at two times the day, morning and evening. It is better to set a fix time for my journaling. What will work best for me? Before setting a time, it is important to note that while writing a journal, I need to be present in the moment. 

Typical format would look like below.

Morning

-   3 Things I’m grateful for today (I’m grateful for… )
-   What will I do to make today great? (Today I will… )
-   Daily affirmations ( I am …)

Evening

-   Highlights of the day where I will write about things that brought a smile to my face.
-   How could I have made today even better? (I could have…) 

That’s all about 5 minute journal.
