## Logic of Arrangement of Life Areas

First of all, I need to make a decision to be productive in order to arrange my wheels of life areas. Once I made decision, my first priority should be to focus on my Health and Fitness. After Health, I need to focus on my personal life which is important Love & Relationships. Only Romantic life is not enough, I need to be align with Social and Community as well. If theses 3 life areas are in good shape, I can get to work on Mind and Wellness. 

If all goes good, I need to focus on My Career and Business which generates some cash flow for that I need to have a Money & Growth area. 

After making personal wellness, relationship well ness, career wellness, I need to focus on Spiritual Wellness, which is the basis of all the life areas.

After that I have my Hobby, Home Environment and Research Areas, which I need to track.

In short all Areas follow in below sequence, 
- Productivity
- Health --> Love --> Relationships --> Mind 
- Work --> Money 
- Soul --> Hobby --> Home --> Research

It might not make sense to others, but it makes sense to me.

## Alignment
- My actions in the here and now are consistent with where I want to be.
- If I make 10 out of 10 in each area, that means
	- Making progress towards things meaningful to us.
	- In balance across all the different areas of life.
	- Enjoying the journey along the way.

## General Note for Areas
- ==One area of life can influence in another area of life.==
	- One area can have positive or negative impact on another area.
- ==You can design your perfect balanced life by managing different areas of life effectively.==
	- Don't ignore key areas of life. Like Health, Relationships.
	- If you ignore those areas it can cause pain in life later.
- ==Ensure you grow in all areas.==
	- In all the main areas of life, you are either growing or dying. We never really standing still.
	- Ensure you are putting yourself first, rather than other peoples.
- ==Assess yourself in each areas of your life Periodically every week, month, year==
	- Rank your self out of 10
		- 8-10 : Doing very well
		- 6-8 : Doing good but not well
		- 3-5 : Not doing good. Needs immediate monitoring.
		- 0-2 : Requires huge improvement
	- Need some method to assess each areas
		- Measurement is important. If you can't measure, you cannot improve.
		- Based on logged data, we can assess life areas.
