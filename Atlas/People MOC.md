# People MOC
Have a place to honor the importance of the people your life. 

- Smaller Circles
	- [[Family, Friends, and Birthdays]]
- Bigger Circles
	- [[People by my eras in life]]
- Special Areas
	- [[People MOC#Prominent People üåã|Prominent People üåã]]
	- [[Entertainment Industry]]
	- [[Literary Industry]]

Once you feel comfortable, adding notes for people‚Äîwhether they are living or not‚Äîyou will notice how it helps your understanding of them. Here are the main things I do related to notes on people:

- Make note of special memories
- Jot down notable information
- Learn entirely new industries
- Learn more about people

## Prominent People üåã
The hope is to see these prominent people in various ways to pull out insights. For example, by date allowed me to see that both Carl Sagan and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi were born in 1934.
