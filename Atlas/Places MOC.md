# Places MOC
Welcome to the Places MOC. It is the most under-developed major category for me, but I value having a "map" for "places", it's rather apt.

### Main Travel Categories
[[Countries I've Been To]]
[[Travel Purgatory List]]

### Some Notable Places
[[Journal of My Travels to XYZ]]
[[Mind Palace XYZ]]

## Notes on Locations
```dataview
TABLE 
FROM #on/travel OR #place 
WHERE file.name != "Places MOC"
SORT BY DESC
```
