# This is where timestamped notes go
This folder called "Calendar" is mostly empty because this is just a starter kit and my daily notes are personal. Think about what notes you might want to sort by date. Here are some common types:

Below is the structure. My Obsidian starts with Today's Daily Note.
- Daily Notes 
	- How to update Daily Note. As per [[0A_1_DailyLog]] template. 
	- Habits 
	- Statistics of Number of Files updated. - Automatic
- Weekly Note
	- Every week, review all daily notes. Add highlights to weekly note. 
	- For this reason. If there is any highlights block. You can put a block reference ^yyyy-mm-dd-sr in the daily note important block. Which you want to highlight into Weekly Note.
- Monthly Note
	- Take all highlights from Weekly notes and put them into monthly note.
- Annual Note
	- Annual note shall have monthly notes transcluded into it.

There is a traversal mechanism to go from one note to another. 
Every Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Annual Notes have links to its previous and next note. In this way, it is easy to between temporal notes.
