## Comments
>[!summary]

Overall this week was not upto the mark from Health Point of View. On the Wednesday, I developed stomach-ache on the left side. This was probably due to Skipping on Tuesday or Lunch of Fruit Salad.

So I did not do Suryanamaskar or any exercise between Wed to Fri. I got developed naval displacement it seems. Because after exercising for naval displacement, pain in the stomach disappeared. We need to lift the leg in 45% while laying on the floor. #highlight/weekly 

On the Weekends, I covered Suryanamaskars so reached to 135 total. Not bad.! Average 19.3 rounds per day. Suryanamaskar is a success. #highlight/weekly 

Improved in Meditation as well. 10 minutes/day. #highlight/weekly
