## What this note is about
- This note contains weekly Lunch plans for every week starting from 2024-W02.

## Why Weekly Lunch Planning is Important
- It helps to estimate grocery shopping.
- It eliminates confusion at every Lunch time 'What would I cook today?'.

## How to Track 
- Every daily note has a link to [[🍲 Food Journal]]. In each daily note, I log what did I eat on each day.
