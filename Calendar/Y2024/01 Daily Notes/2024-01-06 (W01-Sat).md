### ✏️ Logs 
- Morning
	- 30 Surya Namaskar completed. #highlight/daily 
	- After Breakfast, talked with Yashu and Gunjan.
	- Then had a good time with my wife [[@Pooja Zapadiya|@Pooja]].
	- I am happy to know that my consignment of Flute has reached to ISC NEW YORK NY (USPS). #highlight/daily 
		- I am hoping that flutes will be delivered within few days, most probably by the next week.
	- I need to explain Active and Passive Sentence Structure to Pooja.
	- Today I got to resolve obsidian sync issues between Mac and Mobile. #highlight/daily 
		- Configuration Files
			- Mac uses .obsidian folder for configuration files.
			- Mobile uses .obsidian.mobile file for configuration.
		- Pros
			- Data is immediately synced between devices, almost live.
		- Cons
			- Since Configuration files are not shared, plugin configurations and other settings will not be available to mobile and vice versa.
				- Solution: I need to manually sync the configuration files between mobile and mac using computer.

- Afternoon
	- [hacker (defn)](http://catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html)
- Evening
	- [x] Explain about Active and Passive Sentences to Pooja in various sentences.
	- Bought Groceries from Namaste Grocers #highlight/daily 
	- Cleaned up Email of Gmail Account (ajay126zapadiya.exe@gmail.com) #highlight/daily 
		- More than 50k emails are cleaned up using Apple Mail Desktop App. 
		- Sorting by Sender is a good feature.
### 👷‍♂️ Tasks 
- 

### Quick Capture (Mobile Only)
%%Quick Capture Logs%%
Whatever I type here will be updated in my Mac. 😎! In this way, I will avoid the sync issues. Magic!
