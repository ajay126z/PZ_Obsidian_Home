## What is Evening for me?
- My Evening time starts from Sunset (usually 7:00 PM) and ends on Bedtime (11:00 PM).
- It gives me around 4 Hours and `24*10` minutes Blocks.

## Why Evening Routine?
- A proper evening routine can set the tone for a successful day and help you in staying calm, productive, and effective.
- Whenever I lose control throughout my evenings and go to bed stressed and imbalanced, I find it hard to start the next day productively, which often results in a whole ineffective day.
## Tips
- Create a to-do list for the next day:Â It will help you to stay focused and save time as well as energy.
- Reflect on your day:Â Only through reflection, can we take lessons and improve ourselves.
- Calm your mind and let go of negativity, for example, through meditation or journaling.
- Visualize yourself successfully going through your next day
- Avoid big Lunchs at least two hours before going to bed:Â Your sleep quality will improve.
- Avoid your phoneÂ or other screens: this will improve the emission of your sleep hormone and help you to sleep in faster.
- Prepare your outfit for the next dayÂ and save tons of time and energy
- Read a good book:Â this will help you unwind and let go of all the information you processed throughout the day.
- Prepare yourself and your bedroom for a good-quality sleep:Â dim the lights and avoid noises.
