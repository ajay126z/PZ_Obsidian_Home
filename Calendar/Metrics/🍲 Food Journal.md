- ## What is Food Journal?
	- I write what I had during the Morning, Noon and Night to sustain the body activities.
	- ☕️ [[Breakfast]]
	- 🍱 [[Lunch]]
	- 🍲 [[Dinner]]
- ## What kind of food body requires?
	- Body requires energy to properly function. This energy is trapped in the body through the food we put in the body.
## Objective of this Process
- Idea is to create a [[2024-Weekly Meal Plans]] based on the current from Food Journal.
- Weekly Lunch Planner should give clarity, variety, structure in deciding a Lunch. Have a healthy Lunch.
