- ### 📒 Summary + Notes
	- I revisited recently the Best Seller of Peter R. Scholtes titled “The Leader’s Handbook” and went through the following inspiring thoughts:
	- ***“All of the empowered, motivated, teamed-up, self-directed, incentivized, accountable, reengineered, and reinvented people you can muster cannot compensate for a dysfunctional system. When the system is functioning well, these other things are all just foofaraw. When the system is not functioning well, these things are still only empty, meaningless twaddle.”***
	- According to Peter, a well-run organization with well-functioning systems allows people from top to bottom to do work of which they can be proud.
	- When we can work well together doing worthwhile work we can create a joyful workplace as well.
	- #### Old Competencies
		- The book provides an overview of the “*old *competencies” or aptitudes needed to survive and excel in the *old *organization type:
			- *Forcefulness. *Part of a manager’s responsibility was to control the workforce, making people do what they may be otherwise inclined to ignore. Good managers could look their people square in the eye and get them to respond.
			- *Motivator. *The “softer” side of forcefulness was the ability to inspire your people to do great work. The judicious combination of carrots and sticks, of inspiration and exhortation, was the manager’s stock-in-trade.
			- *Decisiveness. *To make quick decisions in the absence of information was routinely expected of the old-style manager.
			- *Willfulness. *Good bosses knew what they wanted and were dogged in their pursuit of it.
			- *Assertiveness. *A good boss was outspoken. Old-style leaders could not show weakness or ignorance lest their people run all over them.
			- *Result- and bottom-line-oriented. *Bosses held people accountable for meeting quotas and standards and achieving measurable goals. Maximizing ever-increasing profits every quarter and minimizing ever-diminishing costs: These were the goals.
			- *Task-oriented. *Managers kept everyone busy and occupied. No slacking off, no socializing. People don’t really want to work and, left to themselves, will screw off. Therefore, be their conscience and taskmaster.
			- *Integrity and diplomacy. *Good bosses covered toughness with tact and amiability. Be honest, fair, and respectful while letting your people know that you know what to do when things get out of hand.
		- The research states that such environments are common and a lot of managers excel in this set of behaviors that continue to be the prevailing expectations of managers there. These old competencies aren’t wrong. Rather, they are simply inadequate or, in some cases, irrelevant.
	- #### New Competencies
		- Then Peter highlights the new competencies, different in nature, adapted to the modern age of management. They are based on very different premises, assumptions, and beliefs about people and organizations. He refers to these new competencies as an interpretation of and elaboration on the priceless work of Dr. Deming’s described in his System of Profound Knowledge.
		- ***Competency 1: The Ability to Think in Terms of [[Systems]] and Knowing How to Lead [[Systems]]***
			- Understanding the difference between [[Systems]] and such things as structure and policy
			- Reflexes to see contexts and flows
			- Instincts to seek systemic causes, not culprits
			- ![System_As_An_Interacting_whole.jpg](../assets/System_As_An_Interacting_whole_1683614248629_0.jpg)
			- When doing so the organization also prevents looping in the set-up-to-fail syndrome.
			-
		- ***Competency 2: The Ability to Understand the Variability of Work in Planning and Problem Solving***
			- Knowing the difference between common cause and special cause of variation
			- Knowing how to respond to common cause variation and to special causes
			- Gathering various important data in appropriate time-ordered charts.
			- ![World_Without_Data.jpg](../assets/World_Without_Data_1683614391951_0.jpg)

		- ***Competency 3. Understanding How We Learn, Develop, and Improve; Leading True Learning and Improvement***
			- Understanding when a statement is theory or opinion versus fact, and acting accordingly
			- Knowing how different people learn differently
			- PDSA (Plan-Do-Study-Act)
			- Providing systems and resources for lifelong learning
			- The difference between change and improvement
		- ***Competency 4. Understanding People and Why They Behave as They Do***
			- Understanding and applying the concepts of internal versus external motivation and demotivation
			- Developing relationships and community within the organization and with those outside
			- Developing and nurturing trust
		- ***Competency 5: Understanding the Interaction and Interdependence between Systems, Variability, Learning, and Human Behavior; Knowing How Each Affects the Others***
			- Seeing the interdependence between systems thinking, variation, learning, and human behavior
		- ***Competency 6: Giving Vision, Meaning, Direction, and Focus to the Organization***
			- Going an inch wide and a mile deep
			- Developing and continuously communicating a clear sense of direction and focus
			- In order to maintain the cohesiveness of an organization and the integrity of its systems, all the members of an organization need to know the following:
				- Who are we?
				- What business are we in?
				- What businesses are we not in?
				- Where are we headed in the long term?
				- What are the priorities for the short term?
				- What values and principles should be characteristics of all our relationships and all of what we do?
				- What is my own personal job and how do my functions and operations fit into the larger purposes and systems of the organization?
				- What is the best way to do my job and what is expected of me? By whom? What is a “good job” and who defines it?
				- How will improvements to my job be accomplished? Who will do the improvements and by what methods? Will I be involved in these improvements? How?
				- What sources and forms of feedback are available to help me know how I’m doing?
	- #### The ==SIPOC== Model
		- SIPOC stands for ==S==uppliers, ==I==nput, ==P==rocesses, ==O==utput, and ==C==ustomers.
		- Learning to apply SIPOC is an indispensable first step in understanding how the approach applies to people's daily work.
		- Your job, and the jobs of all people in your organization consists of a collection of SIPOCs. Your work and theirs is a part of a flow with steps that precede the work and steps that follow.
		- To help you and your people to begin to see the work in its larger systemic context, your must see it as a SIPOC within larger SIPOCs within still larger SIPOCs.
		- ![SIPOC Model.jpg](../assets/SIPOC_Model_1683614851480_0.jpg)
		- When the P in SIPOC is made of those systems, processes and workflows about which the customer care the most, this P is referred to as **Gemba**.
			- These are the processes that develop, add value to, and develop goods and services to your customers.
			- Customers are those who use, apply, and benefit directly from the **Gemba**'s products and services.
	- Finally, connecting to this important work of Peter R. Scholtes is the great research of Daniel H. Pink reported in his book titled “[[Drive]]” in which he reveals that to maximize the enjoyment and productivity for 21st century work, autonomy, mastery, innovation, excellence and purpose are the golden rules.
		- ![Drive.jpg](../assets/Drive_1683615317316_0.jpg)
	- When you observe the companies that have moved from Good To Great, you can notice that they have all gone through the processes above and they are executing their strategy in an impressive disciplined way... The way forward in a disruptive environment of fierce competition.
