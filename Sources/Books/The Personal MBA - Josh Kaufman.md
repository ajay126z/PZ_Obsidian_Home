# 🌍 What It's About
-  This book is about how businesses work.
# 🤔 Why Read this book?
- WHY READ THIS BOOK 
	- You Don’t Need to Know It All 
		- As to methods, there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble. 
			- One of the beautiful things about learning any subject is the fact that you don’t need to know everything—you only need to understand a few critically important concepts that provide most of the value. Once you have a solid scaffold of core principles to work from, building upon your knowledge and making progress becomes much easier.
			- When you first start to study a field, it seems like you have to memorize a zillion things. You don’t. What you need is to identify the core principle s—generally three to twelve of them—that govern the field. The million things you thought you had to memorize are simply various combinations of the core principles.
	- What you need to know
		- How businesses actually work.
		- How to start a new business.
		- How to improve an existing business.
		- How to use business-related skills to accomplish your personal goals. 
			- 226 simple concepts that help you think about business in an entirely new way.
				- To improve your business skills, you don’t need to learn everything there is to know—mastering the fundamentals can take you surprisingly far. I call these foundational business concepts mental models, and together, they create a solid framework you can rely on to make good decisions.
			 - Mental models are concepts that represent your understanding of “how things work.” 
				 - Your brain forms mental models automatically by noticing patterns in what you experience each day. Very often, however, the mental models you form on your own aren’t completely accurate—you’re only one person, so your knowledge and experiences are limited. Education is a way to make your mental models more accurate by internalizing the knowledge and experiences other people have collected throughout their lives. The best education helps you learn to see the world in a new, more productive way [](marginnote3app://note/2F6AE3BB-66B5-4C01-85C8-867269CA848F)

# 🗒️ Notes
Refer: [[Guideline on Book Highlighting]]

## Chapter 1 - Why Read this Book
- About the Book 
	- skip business school, but not business education 
	- This book will help you learn the fundamental principles of business quickly so you can focus your time and energy on actually doing useful things: creating something valuable, attracting attention, closing more sales, serving more customers, getting promoted, making more money, and changing the world. 
		- The books themselves aren’t as important as the ideas and knowledge they contain, but many of my readers were missing out because it took hours of turning pages to get to the good stuff.
	- Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is.

> [!quote]
> Many who are self-taught far excel the doctors, masters, and bachelors of the most renowned universities.
 — ISAAC ASIMOV, FORMER PROFESSOR OF BIOCHEMISTRY AT BOSTON UNIVERSITY AND AUTHOR OF OVER FIVE HUNDRED BOOKS.
	
 —LUDWIG VON MISES, AUSTRIAN ECONOMIST AND AUTHOR OF HUMAN ACTION [](marginnote3app://note/E1D9448C-9918-42BD-A5C8-4EEE4EB0579F)
		- It is important that students bring a certain ragamuffin, barefoot irreverence to their studies; they are not here to worship what is known, but to question it.
 —JACOB BRONOWSKI, WRITER AND PRESENTER OF THE ASCENT OF MAN [](marginnote3app://note/2AF7EFE1-510E-439E-B894-C6A671A625E0)
	- Whoever best describes the problem is the one most likely to solve it.

	- Life’s tough. It’s tougher if you’re stupid.

- About Author [](marginnote3app://note/BEB08E60-B463-426C-BC36-61EDA3C8530B)
	- If there’s one thing I’m good at, it’s taking in a huge amount of information and distilling it to the essentials. I’m a synthesist by nature, and my travels through the world of business literature quickly became an exercise in separating the diamonds from the rough. [](marginnote3app://note/407AC310-DFBB-4FE8-B56D-271C8AE50282)
		- I began tracking which resources were valuable and which ones weren’t, then publishing my findings on my Web site, both as an archive and for the benefit of anyone interested. It was a personal project, nothing more: I was just a recent college graduate doing my best to learn something useful, and publishing my research for others seemed like a good use of time and energy.
 One fateful morning, however, the Personal MBA went unexpectedly public, and my life changed permanently. [](marginnote3app://note/701081E1-75E4-4757-9349-6056BA86888B)
	- As it turned out, my self-education served me well—I was doing valuable work, making things happen, and getting good reviews. As time went on, however, I realized three very important things: 1. Large companies move slowly. Good ideas often died on the vine simply because they had to be approved by too many people. 2. Climbing the corporate ladder is an obstacle to doing great work. I wanted to focus on getting things done and making things better, not constantly positioning myself for promotion. Politics and turf wars are an inescapable part of the daily experience of working for a large company. 3. Frustration leads to burnout. I wanted to enjoy the daily experience of work, but instead I felt like I was running a gauntlet each day. It began to affect my health, happiness, and relationships. The longer I stayed in the corporate world, the more I realized I wanted out. I desperately wanted to work on my own terms, as an entrepreneur.

- Munger’s Mental Models [](marginnote3app://note/616D5568-5AC3-48CB-AD41-30221A8D663F)
	- I think it’s undeniably true that the human brain works in models. The trick is to have your brain work better than the other person’s brain because it understands the most fundamental models—the ones that do the most work.
 —CHARLES T. MUNGER, BILLIONAIRE BUSINESS PARTNER OF WARREN BUFFETT, CEO OF WESCO FINANCIAL, AND VICE-CHAIRMAN OF BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY [](marginnote3app://note/7AEE6371-D8F1-43BC-AEDC-080172FFAB82)
	- 1965, he left the law firm he had created to start an investment partnership, which went on to outperform the market by 14 percent compounded annually over fourteen years—an astounding record given his complete lack of formal business education. [](marginnote3app://note/6EDF2E1E-EFC4-4E1D-9991-E0168BCF502B)
	- Buffett and Munger purchased Berkshire Hathaway, a floundering textile manufacturer, in 1975, turning it into a conglomerate investment holding company. Together, Buffett and Munger became billionaires [](marginnote3app://note/5414E2AD-4097-446D-8CD4-C63BF4A92F39)
	- According to Buffett, Charlie’s mental-model-centric approach to business is a major contributing factor in the success of Berkshire Hathaway and Buffett’s status as one of the world’s wealthiest business owners: “Charlie can analyze and evaluate any kind of deal faster and more accurately than any man alive. He sees any valid weakness in sixty seconds. He’s the perfect partner [](marginnote3app://note/8BDD64E3-4924-4BC4-9D49-E5F9C2BBD308)
		- The secret to Charlie’s success is a systematic way of understanding how businesses actually work. Even though he never formally studied business, his relentless self-education in a wide variety of subjects allowed him to construct what he called a “latticework of mental models,” which he then applied to making business decisions [](marginnote3app://note/7FA0F8D7-45C0-4E5E-B432-BBD0D3C9E9DB)
			- I’ve long believed that a certain system—which almost any intelligent person can learn—works way better than the systems most people use [to understand the world]. What you need is a latticework of mental models in your head. And, with that system, things gradually fit together in a way that enhances cognition.
 Just as multiple factors shape every system, multiple mental models from a variety of disciplines are necessary to understand that system . . . You have to realize the truth of biologist Julian Huxley’s idea that, “Life is just one damn relatedness after another. ” So you must have all the models, and you must see the relatedness and the effects f rom the relatedness . . [](marginnote3app://note/148C7597-4685-4AAF-82EB-A75AFB88CA71)
			- psychological principles he finds most useful in Poor Charlie’s Almanack, a recent biography—but there was no single text that contained “everything you need to know in order to succeed in business. [](marginnote3app://note/CD1FC4FD-5F03-447C-A95A-E69FC6ED8DC6)
- Connecting the dots [](marginnote3app://note/1A14BF2A-AB25-482A-9270-0BB1A6B62631)
	- In all affairs, it’s a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted. —BERTRAND RUSSELL, RENOWNED PHILOSOPHER AND AUTHOR OF THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY AND THE PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS [](marginnote3app://note/247C87AD-90A3-42A1-BAD0-A2A75BA227BD)
	- Definition of Business [](marginnote3app://note/BBE153F0-2564-423A-9771-8EA8CE972224)
		- Every successful business 
			1. creates or provides something of value that 
			2. other people want or need 
			3. at a price they’re willing to pay, in a way that 
			4. satisfies the purchaser’s needs and expectations and 
			5. provides the business sufficient revenue to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation.[](marginnote3app://note/BBE153F0-2564-423A-9771-8EA8CE972224)
		- Take away any of these things—value creation, customer demand, transactions, value delivery, or profit sufficiency—and you have something other than a business. Each factor is both essential and universal. [](marginnote3app://note/2397FA23-56C1-40FD-9750-EEB600AC013D)
			- Value can’t be created without understanding what people want (market research). 
			- Attracting customers first requires getting their attention, then making them interested (marketing). 
			- In order to close a sale, people must first trust your ability to deliver on what’s promised (value delivery and operations).
			- Customer satisfaction depends on reliably exceeding the customer’s expectations (customer service). 
			- Profit sufficiency requires bringing in more money than is spent (finance). 
	- Every business fundamentally relies on two additional factors: people and systems 
		- Every business is created by people and survives by benefiting other people in some way. To understand how businesses work, you must have a firm understanding of how people tend to think and behave—how humans make decisions, act on those decisions, and communicate with others. Recent advances in psychology and neuroscience are revealing why people do the things they do, as well as how to improve our own behavior and work more effectively with others. 
		- Systems, on the other hand, are the invisible structures that hold every business together. At the core, every business is a collection of processes that can be reliably repeated to produce a particular result. By understanding the essentials of how complex systems work, it’s possible to find ways to improve existing systems, whether you’re dealing with a marketing campaign or an automotive assembly line
