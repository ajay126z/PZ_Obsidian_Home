# üåç What It's About
1.  Share your thoughts and your process and your work, online, for free.
2.  You don‚Äôt need to be an expert to share your work - beginners can easily help other beginners.
3.  By sharing your work online, you‚Äôll attract an audience of people who care about the same stuff you do - this can change your life.

# üîç How I Discovered It
-  Online

# ‚úçÔ∏è My Top 3 Quotes
> Amateurs know that contributing something is better than contributing nothing

>  Carving out a space for yourself online, somewhere where you can express yourself and share your work, is still one of the best possible investments you can make with your time.

> The minute you learn something, turn around and teach it to others. Share your reading list. Point to helpful reference materials. Create some tutorials and post them online. Use pictures, words, and video. Take people step-by-step through part of your process. As blogger Kathy Sierra says, ‚Äúmake people better at something they want to be better at‚Äù.

# üìí Summary + Notes
## A new way of operating

The world has changed. It‚Äôs no longer enough to just _make_ stuff and hope that people find it. You have to be _findable._ 

> ==**Build Sharing into your ROUTINE.**==

Think of your work as a never-ending process. You can share your process in a way that attracts others.

> Imagine if your next boss didn‚Äôt have to read your r√©sum√© because he already reads your blog. Imagine being a student and getting your first gig based on a school project you posted online. Imagine losing your job but having a social network of people familiar with your work and ready to help you find a new one. Imagine turning a side project or a hobby into your profession because you had a following that could support you.

> Or imagine something simpler and just as satisfying: spending the majority of your time, energy, and attention practicing a craft, learning a trade, or running a business, while also allowing for the possibility that your work might attract a group of people who share your interests.

> All you have to do is show your work.

Example, 
[[Steal Like an Artist]] - Stealing Influence from other people
[[Show Your Work]] - How to influence others by letting them steal from you.

> **==Crafting something is a long, uncertain process. A Maker should show his work.==**

## 1. You don‚Äôt have to be a genius

**Find a Scenius -** We need to move away from the _lone genius_ myth of creativity.

‚ÄúScenius‚Äù is a healthier way to think about creativity - ‚Äúa whole scene of people supporting each other, looking at each other‚Äôs work, copying from each other, stealing ideas, and contributing ideas‚Äù.

Anyone can contribute to the scenius. You don‚Äôt have to be an expert.

How to do it. ==Find a scenius, pay attention to what others are sharing, and then start taking note of what they‚Äôre not sharing. Be on the lookout for voids that you can fill with your own efforts, no matter how bad they are at first. Don‚Äôt worry, for now, about how you‚Äôll make money or a career off it. Forget about being an expert or a professional, and wear your amateurism (your heart, your love) on your sleeve. Share what you love, and the people who love the same things will find you.==

**Be an Amateur -** Sometimes, amateurs have more to teach us than experts. An amateur understands the beginners mind. The expert doesn‚Äôt.

Find something you want to learn. And learn it in front of others. Share your process. Share your successes, and more importantly, your failures. Help others who want to be on the same path.

On the spectrum of creative work, the difference between the mediocre and the good is vast. Mediocrity is, however, still on the spectrum; you can move from mediocre to good in increments. The real gap is between doing nothing and doing something.

The fellow-pupil can help more than the master because he knows less. The difficulty we want him to explain is one he has recently met. The expert met it so long ago he has forgotten.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm an artist, man,‚Äù said John Lennon. ‚ÄúGive me a tuba, and I‚Äôll get you something out of it.‚Äù

**Find Your Voice** - The only way to find your voice is to use it. You can't find your voice if you don't use it. Talk about the things you love, your voice will follow.

Questions for New tool.
	- What was it mode for?
	- How others are using it?
	- What use can I find for it?

> ==If your work isn‚Äôt online, it doesn‚Äôt exist.== If you want people to know about what you do and the things you care about, you have to share.

> Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. It is the most important tool I‚Äôve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.

I‚Äôm not going to sit here and wait for things to happen, I‚Äôm going to make them happen, and if people think I‚Äôm an idiot I don‚Äôt care.

## 2. Think process, not product

**Take people behind the scenes -** The _finished product_ model of creativity is a relic of the pre-digital era. Where the only way artists could find an audience for their work was to show the finished product in all its glory. The internet has changed this. People really do want to see how the sausage gets made. Audiences want to see the person behind the product.

‚ÄúA lot of people are so used to just seeing the outcome of work. They never see the side of the work you go through to produce the outcome.‚Äù
--> Michael Jackson

Art and Fear Book 
"To all viewers but yourself, what matters is the product: the finished artwork. 
To you, and you alone, what matters is the process: the experience of shaping the artwork"

The work is all that's happened in a day. It is a process, not a thing. 

**Become a documentarian of what you do -** As Gary Vaynerchuk says, ‚Äúdocument, don‚Äôt create‚Äù. Share screenshots as you‚Äôre going along. Take photos of your process. Write down your thoughts in a notebook. Whether you share it or not, documenting your process has its own rewards.

Human beings are interested in other human beings and what other human beings do. ‚ÄúPeople really do want to see how the sausage gets made.‚Äù

=> By putting things out there, consistently, you can form a relationship with your customers. It allows them to see the person behind the products.

## 3. Share something small everyday
Questions:
	- How are you feeling? - Google
	- What's on your mind? - Facebook
	- What's happening? - Twitter
	- What are you working on? - Dribble
	- What do you want to talk about? - LinkedIn

**Sharing vs Oversharing -** Share stuff that might be helpful or interesting or entertaining to someone on the other side of the screen.

I think of it as ‚ÄúWill this potentially help at least one person in the world? If so, I should share it.‚Äù

![[33671823-DC1F-410A-821C-324CEF305001.jpeg]]

**Turn your flow into Stock** - 
Flow is the feed. It‚Äôs the posts and the tweets. It‚Äôs the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that remind people you exist. 
Stock is the durable stuff. It‚Äôs the content you produce that‚Äôs as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It‚Äôs what people discover via search. It‚Äôs what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over time.

Magic formula => To maintain your flow while working on your stock in the background.
Your stock is best made by collecting, organizing, and expanding upon your flow.

For example, a lot of the ideas in this book started out as tweets, which then became blog posts, which then became book chapters. Small things, over time, can get big.

![[DDA3FCDF-687F-481F-9B48-22A38DA864D9.jpeg]]

**Get your own domain name -** You need a personal website. Yes, even you reading this now. You might not have anything to write yet. But trust me (and Austin) - you need a personal website. Go find a domain name, preferably www.[yourname].com, but if that‚Äôs not available, use another extension (eg: .co.uk, .com.pk, .io, .me etc, there are hundreds of them). Figure out how to install a blog on it (eg: Wordpress or Ghost, I prefer Ghost personally). Yes if you‚Äôve never done this before it‚Äôll take some time and you‚Äôll have to do some Googling. But it‚Äôll be one of the best investments you ever make with your time.

==Don‚Äôt think of your website as a self-promotion machine, think of it as a selfinvention machine. Online, you can become the person you really want to be. Fill your website with your work and your ideas and the stuff you care about. Over the years, you will be tempted to abandon it for the newest, shiniest social network. Don‚Äôt give in. Don‚Äôt let it fall into neglect. Think about it in the long term. Stick with it, maintain it, and let it change with you over time.==

Build a good domain name, keep it clean, and eventually it will be its own currency. Whether people show up or they don‚Äôt, you‚Äôre out there, doing your thing, ready whenever they are.

## 4. Open up your cabinet of curiosities

**Don't be a Hoarder** - 
See the act of reading and the act of writing as existing on opposite ends of the same spectrum: The reading feeds the writing, which feeds the reading.

"I‚Äôm basically a curator,‚Äù says the writer and former bookseller Jonathan Lethem. ‚ÄúMaking books has always felt very connected to my bookselling experience, that of wanting to draw people‚Äôs attention to things that I liked, to shape things that I liked into new shapes.‚Äù

**Share other people‚Äôs work -** We all like different things. If you can share the stuff you like, if you can curate it for others, good things will happen.

Support : For the first couple years you make stuff, it‚Äôs just not that good. It‚Äôs trying to be good, it has potential, but it‚Äôs not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. Before we‚Äôre ready to take the leap of sharing our own work with the world, we can share our tastes in the work of others.

"Where do you get your inspiration? What sorts of things do you fill your head with? What do you read? Do you subscribe to anything? What sites do you visit on the Internet? What music do you listen to? What movies do you see? Do you look at art? What do you collect? What‚Äôs inside your scrapbook? What do you pin to the corkboard above your desk? What do you stick on your refrigerator? Who‚Äôs done work that you admire? Who do you steal ideas from? Do you have any heroes? Who do you follow online? Who are the practitioners you look up to in your field?"" Your influences are all worth sharing because they clue people in to who you are and what you do‚Äîsometimes even more than your own work.

**No Guilty Pleasures** - We all love things that other people think are garbage. You have to have the courage to keep loving your garbage, because what makes us unique is the diversity and breadth of our influences, the unique ways in which we mix up the parts of culture others have deemed ‚Äúhigh‚Äù and the ‚Äúlow.‚Äù

*==When you find things you genuinely enjoy, don‚Äôt let anyone else make you feel bad about it. Don‚Äôt feel guilty about the pleasure you take in the things you enjoy. Celebrate them. When you share your taste and your influences, have the guts to own all of it. Don‚Äôt give in to the pressure to self-edit too much.==*

**Credit is always due -** Obviously, if you‚Äôre sharing other people‚Äôs work, you want to credit them. Attribution = providing context for what you‚Äôre sharing. It‚Äôs about putting little museum labels next to the stuff you share. Preferably attribute with a link. Eg: thanks [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/) for writing this book.

*Crediting work in our copy-and-paste age of reblogs and retweets can seem like a futile effort, but it‚Äôs worth it, and it‚Äôs the right thing to do. You should always share the work of others as if it were your own, treating it with respect and care.*

## 5. Tell good stories

**Work Doesn't Speak for itself** - ***Tell a Story***

People want to read (and hear) good stories. You‚Äôll become more effective at sharing yourself and your work if you can tell a good story.

‚ÄúWhen shown an object, or given a food, or shown a face, people‚Äôs assessment of it‚Äîhow much they like it, how valuable it is‚Äîis deeply affected by what you tell them about it.‚Äù

Examples, Painting of 17th century Vs Latest one copy.

*Why to tell Stories? Why not telling stories is not convincing.* 
Words matter. Artists love to trot out the tired line, ‚ÄúMy work speaks for itself,‚Äù but the truth is, our work doesn‚Äôt speak for itself. Human beings want to know where things came from, how they were made, and who made them. The stories you tell about the work you do have a huge effect on how people feel and what they understand about your work, and how people feel and what they understand about your work effects how they value it.

Our audience is a human one, and humans want to connect. Personal stories can make the complex more tangible, spark associations, and offer entry into things that might otherwise leave one cold.

**Structure is Everything** - ***How to Construct a Story***

If you want to be more effective when sharing yourself and your work, you need to become a better storyteller. You need to know what a good story is and how to tell one.

Example, ‚Äú‚ÄòThe cat sat on a mat‚Äô is not a story. ‚ÄòThe cat sat on the dog‚Äôs mat‚Äô is a story.‚Äù

![[87F7D9FC-C4A4-4618-B4D5-7CCDB90AE3E4.png]]



**Talk about yourself at parties -** It‚Äôs okay to talk about yourself if people ask. Don‚Äôt think of it as an interrogation. Think of it as a chance to connect with someone who might be interested in your work.

## 6. Teach what you know

> The impulse to keep to yourself what you have learned is not only shameful, it is destructive. Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you. You open your safe and find ashes. -Annie Dillard

Teaching people doesn‚Äôt take away from what you do, it adds to it. When you teach someone how to do your work, you‚Äôre actually generating more interest in your work. People will feel closer to it because you‚Äôre teaching them what you know.

When you teach and share your work with others, you‚Äôll get an education in return. People will see your stuff, connect with it, and reach out to you with recommendations and their own thoughts. This is magic.

## 7. Don‚Äôt turn into human spam

> If you want fans, you have to be a fan first. If you want to be accepted by a community, you have to first be a good citizen of that community. If you‚Äôre only pointing to your own stuff online, you‚Äôre doing it wrong. You have to be a connector. The writer Blake Butler calls this being an open node. If you want to get, you have to give. If you want to be noticed, you have to notice. Shut up and listen once in a while. Be thoughtful. Be considerate. Don‚Äôt turn into human spam. Be an open node.

**You want hearts, not eyeballs -** Stop caring about how many people read your stuff and how many people follow you online.

**The vampire test -** ‚ÄúWhatever excites you, go do it. Whatever drains you, stop doing it‚Äù - Derek Sivers

**Meet people IRL** - Make online friends, and then meet them in real life. Meet-ups are great. If you know someone online and you‚Äôre in the same town, grab a coffee with them. When you‚Äôre travelling, let your online friends know you‚Äôre going to be around.

> Meeting people online is awesome, but turning them into IRL friends is even better.

_In fact, as I write this in a coffee shop in central Cambridge, I‚Äôm sitting with a guy called Ross. He‚Äôs a doctor with an interest in medical education, and he found my work online. He emailed me saying he was in Cambridge and wanted to grab lunch. We‚Äôve been hanging out for the past 4 hours - first we grabbed lunch at a burger place, and then we came over to this coffee shop. I‚Äôm writing this book summary. He‚Äôs sitting opposite me reading a book that I recommended (The Third Door by Alex Banayan). We‚Äôre IRL friends now :)_

## 8. Learn to take a punch

When you put stuff out there, you‚Äôre going to get a bit of criticism. This is natural. Learn to take it. Don‚Äôt let the fear of haters stop you from putting yourself out there. They‚Äôre a tiny minority, and they have no real power over you.

> Compulsive avoidance of embarrassment is a form of suicide. - Colin Marshall.

Don‚Äôt spend your life avoiding vulnerability. If you do, you and your work will never truly connect with people.

## 9. Sell out

We need to get over our ‚Äústarving artist‚Äù romanticism. There‚Äôs nothing wrong or evil about money. Charging money for stuff doesn‚Äôt hamper your creativity.

> Michaelangelo painted the Sistine Chapel ceiling because the pop commissioned him.

But at the same time, be careful about selling the work you love.

> Beware of selling the things that you love: When people are asked to get out their wallets, you find out how much they really value what you do. My friend John T. Unger tells this terrific story from his days as a street poet. He would do a poetry reading and afterward some guy would come up to him and say, ‚ÄúYour poem changed my life, man!‚Äù And John would say, ‚ÄúOh, thanks. Want to buy a book? It‚Äôs five dollars.‚Äù And the guy would take the book, hand it back to John, and say, ‚ÄúNah, that‚Äôs okay.‚Äù To which John would respond, ‚ÄúGeez, how much is your life worth?‚Äù

**Keep a mailing list -** Even if you don‚Äôt have anything to sell right now, keep a mailing list. There are people who run multimillion dollar businesses off their mailing lists. The model is simple - give away free great free stuff on your website. Collect the emails of people who enjoy reading it. When you have something remarkable to sell or share, send them an email letting them know.

**Pay it forward -** When you have success, help people who reach out to you. Help people who helped you get where you are.

**Caveat -** Don‚Äôt sacrifice your art or your work for the sake of answering emails. Be as generous as you can, but selfish enough to get your work done.

## 10. Stick around

**Don‚Äôt quit -** Keep doing your work, and keep sharing.

**Take sabbaticals.**

Don‚Äôt be afraid to change things up. It‚Äôs not really starting over. You‚Äôre still keeping everything you learned before. You‚Äôre just starting from chapter one again.

# ‚òòÔ∏è How the Book Changed Me
> üí° How my life/ behavior / thoughts / ideas have changes as a result of reading the book

- It made me more comfortable with sharing my thoughts and my work online
-  It made me generally more comfortable with putting myself 'out there'
-  It made me start my blog
-  Starting the blog was the first step to starting my YouTube channel a year later, and the YouTube channel changed my life.

This is one of the three books that most changed my life (the others being [[Power of Now - Eckhart Tolle]] and [[Death - Sadhguru]].

It completely changed the way I thought about sharing stuff online, and encouraged me to start my blog in January 2016.

## ü•∞ Who Would Like it ?
I think this should be required reading for everyone in the world. If you‚Äôve got an interest in creativity (of any sort) or entrepreneurship or business (of any sort), you should stop reading this and just read the book.

Even if you don‚Äôt have the slightest interest in creativity, entrepreneurship or putting yourself out there in any capacity whatsoever, you should still read this because it‚Äôll open up neural pathways and possibilities that you never knew existed.

It also takes less than 30 minutes to read, so you‚Äôve got no reason not to.
