# 🗒️ Notes
Refer: [[Guideline on Book Highlighting]]

> If you paint the pages you don’t know a lot about getting information and treating books. Also, [underlining is utterly useless](http://takingnotenow.blogspot.com/2013/08/underlining-in-library-books.html) in most cases: you don’t magically remember the content better if you underline it word for word, sentence by sentence. Underlining won’t help you _remember_; marks are there to aid understanding in a later phase of reading.
