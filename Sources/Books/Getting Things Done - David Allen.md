# 📒 Summary + Notes

## Why GTD

One of the reasons [GTD](https://facilethings.com/blog/en/ultimate-guide-to-gtd) has achieved great recognition as a **personal productivity system** is that it doesn’t reduce our daily activity to a simple set of tasks to be marked as done. That’s oversimplified. Although being productive is about getting more done with as little effort as possible, we aren’t machines. We’re human beings, and our actions must respond to something deeper.

Traditional [time management](https://facilethings.com/blog/en/self-management) systems (still prevalent in many people’s minds) simplify all our activity to a **list of tasks** to which we assign a priority. This priority is a number, a letter or a symbol that we simply write next to the task, and usually remains there forever. It often represents a degree of [urgency, rather than importance](https://facilethings.com/blog/en/time-management-matrix). These systems don’t take into account that the importance of things varies over time, because new commitments continually arise that make the importance of all of the above relative.

A list of 70 tasks in which 30 of them have the same priority, very high, makes it very difficult and stressful to simply decide which is **the next action to perform**. In the absence of something that relates these tasks to us as individuals, something that objectively indicates the importance of performing each action, we will always choose a task that can be done in 15 minutes rather than one that needs 2 hours. Moreover, low-priority tasks always remain undone, until they generate a crisis and then there’s no choice but to pay attention to them.

Another alternative, even worse, is to enter each and every one of our tasks in **a calendar** and [make it rule our life](https://facilethings.com/blog/en/calendar-is-not-a-todo-list). Sounds weird? Well, there are still many people who tell me that their only personal management tool is Google Calendar. There’s an absolute lack of context in this type of organization. Moreover, it’s practically impossible to predict the time that each task is going to take us, so we’ll need to spend a good part of our time on the frustrating task of reorganizing the actions in the calendar (changing the day, the time, modifying their duration, etc.).

**Reality is complex and changing**. We cannot manage it with a simple piece of paper. And by that I mean a piece of paper, a calendar or a simple to-do app. We are human beings. There are internal forces that move us, that give meaning to our lives, although not all of us are aware of them at all times. If we want to be more effective in what we do, we must incorporate these forces into our personal management.

GTD uses [lists of items](https://facilethings.com/gtd-dictionary/en/lists) that don’t need to be constantly reorganized unless the nature of an action changes; it introduces [objective criteria](https://facilethings.com/gtd-dictionary/en/four-criteria-model-for-choosing-actions) to choose the next action to perform, such as the *context* you are in, your *energy* and your available *time*; and it uses solid values such as your [goals and focus areas](https://facilethings.com/gtd-dictionary/en/six-level-model-for-reviewing-your-own-work) to prioritize certain projects and tasks. It’s not just about **getting thingsdone**, it’s about making our activity meaningful. Why do we do what we do? GTD provides a framework that allows you to achieve a deeper understanding of your reality. And even just for that reason alone, it’s something worth knowing about.

## Work flow of GTD
### 1. Capture
 ![[2022-08-14-22-18-32.jpeg]]
- The first step of GTD is to note down everything that catches your attention, anything that is significant and that you are not doing anything about.
- Watch out! Capturing does not mean interrupting what you are doing and getting distracted doing another thing. It is just reacting to something that comes to your mind and noting it down, without thinking about it or spending more time on it at that precise moment — you'll deal with the details in the second step.
- For example, if you are working on your computer and suddenly you think you should call to a friend you haven't talked to for a long time to find out how he's doing, you just need to write down "call Anthony" with some usual capture tool (notebook, app, etc.) and continue working without wasting any more time.
- We speak of *noting down* but capturing can be anything: taking a photo with your mobile, recording a voice memo, writing in a notebook, typing in an app, etc. The important thing is that all this inventory of incompletes is collected in a reliable external system until it is time to decide what they are and what to do with them.
- A good practice is to use the fewest number of inboxes possible; that will facilitate further processing of stuff.
- When you capture well you achieve two things: you educate your attention to avoid interruptions and [you reduce stress](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222552899_Getting_Things_Done_The_Science_Behind_Stress-Free_Productivity), since all those things are left out of your head, without causing discomfort, in a reliable and accessible place.
- Simple, right? Well, not so much. You need to establish the habit of capturing anything, even what seems unimportant, and avoid the urge to quit what you are doing at that time, even if it's only a few minutes.
- Also, the mere fact of having all your incompletes captured will not make you more effective. You need to clarify these stuff and empty your inboxes regularly.

### 2. Clarify
![[2022-08-14-22-19-10.jpeg]]
- The second step of GTD is to clearly define each of the captures you got in the first step and decide what you are going to do with them — if you are going to do anything at all.
- Clarify is an iterative process in which you ask yourself a series of questions about every stuff you have captured and organize the results accordingly, leaving the inbox empty at the end of the process.
- Let's see how that process unfolds:
		- For each capture, the first question you need to ask is **what is it?** You need to define as precisely as possible what that stuff means to you.
		- Then you will ask yourself, **is it actionable?** That is, can you do something about it and also want to do it?
			- **If the item is not actionable**, then what can you do with the capture? Basically one of three things:
				- *Throw it away*, if it's something that you're not going to do and is of no interest to you.
				- *Incubate it*, if it's something you can't or don't want to do now, but maybe later.
				- *File it*, if it's information that may be useful to you.
			- **If it's actionable stuff**, you will have to specify **what is the next action?** The *next action* is the next visible, physical activity that moves something forward to its completion.
				- Once you have defined the next action that should be taken to get closer to the desired result, what are you going to do about that action? There are three possibilities:
					- *Do it*, if you need less than 2 minutes to complete it.
					- *Delegate it*, if you are not the right person to do it.
					- *Defer it*, if it takes more than 2 minutes and you need to do it yourself.
				- Finally, **will it be necessary to take more than one action to achieve the final result?** If so, you need to describe that result and add it to a project list. This will serve as a reminder that this job is still not finished when you have completed the action.
- It may seem like a complicated process, but these questions will run through your head automatically, effortlessly, after a few repetitions.
- Notice that every time you process all your captures you will have trashed what you don't need, completed small actions of less than two minutes, delegated anything that can be done by other people, created specific reminders for actions you need to carry out, and identified projects you want to commit to. In other words, you will have transformed a lot of undefined stuff into an organized system that you can control. That generates peace of mind!
- But what does incubating, filing, delegating, or deferring really mean? We will see that in the third article about the 5 Steps of GTD.

### 3. Organise
![[2022-08-14-22-20-05.jpeg]]
- A good personal management system needs good organization. And GTD has it! The third step of GTD is about putting everything in its place.
- The Clarify and Organize steps are done consecutively: each time you clarify something that you consider incomplete, you need to create a reminder of it and, depending on its nature, put it in the appropriate organizational category.
- You need six organizational categories to keep track of your reminders:
		- *Calendar*. It is used for the actions that you need to do on a specific day or at a specific time. It can also include information that you need to know on a specific date, such as a deadline.
		- *Next Actions*. Here you will put all the actions that you need to do yourself as soon as possible, at no specific date. A *context* defines where you have to be or what you need to be able to carry out an action ("home", "computer", etc.). It is recommended to group your next actions by contexts, so you can focus only on the actions that you can do at any time.
		- *Agendas*. They contain reminders of the next actions that require other people, so you can focus on all of those issues the next time you meet or speak with them.
		- *Waiting For*. It is a list that contains reminders of the delegated actions.
		- *Project List*. It contains all the outcomes that you have committed to, but have not yet completed.
		- *Someday/Maybe*. Here you will incubate all those things that you cannot or do not want to act on for the moment, but want to consider again later.
- You also need other tools to store real objects, not reminders:
		- *Trash*. A place to throw out thingsthat no longer have any potential value to you.
		- *File System*. Here you will store potentially useful or interesting information. This tool is usually divided into two sections:
			- *Reference material*, for infrequently used information that you don't need to have very close.
			- *Support material*, for more frequently used information, related to your projects in progress, that you need to have handy.
- Since your brain is good at relating places and meanings, you can lower its cognitive load by using containers with a clear meaning. That's why this kind of organization allows you to be less stressed and be more effective.

### 4. Reflect
![[2022-08-14-22-20-45.jpeg]]
- The fourth step of GTD is called Reflect, but it basically consists of reviewing your system on a regular basis to ensure that it continues to be a faithful representation of your reality.
- The Weekly Review is the process that allows you to update your personal management system in order to face the week ahead with complete peace of mind.
- Let's see what the Weekly Review consists of, step by step:
		- *1. Gain clarity.*
			- **Capture** all the things that are not in the system yet. Gather loose papers and materials, electronic inputs pending processing, and empty your mind.
			- **Clarify** all those stuff and empty your inboxes.
		- *2. Get up to date.*
			- Review your **past calendar**. If there is anything still pending, move it into the active system. Capture everything that may require action.
			- Review your **future calendar**. You may need to capture actions to prepare for a planned activity in the coming weeks.
			- Review the **Next Actions** lists. Delete the completed actions and review the lists of contexts and agendas. Capture new actions if necessary.
			- Review the **Waiting For** list. Delete the delegated actions that you have already received. Capture reminders to keep track of actions that are not progressing properly.
			- Review the **Project list**. Review the state of the projects one by one, and make sure you have at least one next action on the way for each of them.
		- *3. Get creative.*
			- Review the **Someday/Maybe** list. If there is an incubated project that has become interesting, activate it and move it to the project list. Eliminate all those items that are no longer relevant.
			- Be creative and courageous. Now that you have a clearer perspective on your life, it is a good time to think about new ideas and stuff. **Capture**everything you can think of.
- It will take a little while to do the Weekly Review, but I can't stress enough how important it is to do it. It is the glue that keeps your system reliable as soon as a crack appears. Don't skip it!

### 5. Engage
![[2022-08-14-22-21-18.jpeg]]
- The purpose of the 4 steps before this one is to create a workflow that helps you make good decisions about what you could be doing at any time.
- The fifth step of GTD, Engage, is about choosing the best action to carry out from among all your options. And getting it done, of course. If you have put in place a complete personal management system and keep it updated, most of the time you will be doing things that are already on your action lists.
- In this case, it will only take you a moment to choose which is the best action to take at this precise moment:
		- If you have something to do written down in the **Calendar**, then you need to focus on that action (the Calendar should contain things that must necessarily be done on a certain date or time).
		- If there is nothing to do in the Calendar, you will need to look at your **Next Actions** lists, where presumably you will have accumulated a good number of actions. How will you choose what action to take next, feeling good with your choice? GTD suggests that you choose it based on these criteria:
			- *The context in which you are*. Some actions can be carried out anywhere, but most require a specific place, someone's presence, or access to specific tools. What actions can you do in your current context?
			- *Your available time*. Activities coming up soon, for example a meeting within an hour, can limit your options. Look only at the actions that you can complete in the time you have available right now.
			- *Your available energy*. If you are tired or not feeling very well, narrow your options to actions that don't demand a lot of mental or physical energy. Try not to embark on tasks that demand more than you can give right now.
			- *The relative priority of each action*. Once the list of actions has been reduced based on the previous criteria, of those that remain, which one does it make more sense to do right now?

- Congratulations! You already are equipped with the necessary knowledge to implement the 5 steps of GTD.
- If you think about it, it's just common sense: You need to *capture* everything that have your attention, *clarify* what each thing means and decide what you are going to do with it, *organize* reminders in the appropriate lists, and *reflect* on those lists regularly to keep them up to date, so that you can *engage* at all times with the optimal action.
- Practicing this workflow and making it a habit is all you need to enjoy a much more effective and relaxed personal and professional life. Go ahead and try it! 💪

- Now you are ready to start using this methodology with any tool, even pen and paper.
- The problem with using "any tool" at first is that, having not yet assimilated the GTD habits, it's easy to slip back into unproductive behaviors after a while.
- Open the door to a calmer, more productive and meaningful life!

## ==Detailed Workflow Summary==
### Capture
#### What it is?
- Gathering everything that catches your attention in reliable external containers that you empty regularly.
- It is about collecting all those issues that you consider incomplete, those that might need to be closed or something must be done about them.
#### How do you do it?
- By collecting out of your head the thing that catches your attention using a capturing tool ([[$Things3]], [[$Logseq]] Daily Journal, Project Pages etc.), without thinking and immediately going back to what you were doing.
#### Prompts
- What tasks, commitments, or ideas are currently on your mind?
- Is there anything you need to remember or act upon in the future?
- Are there any important emails, documents, or messages that require attention?
- What are the potential distractions or concerns that you want to capture and address?

#### When do you do it?
- The very moment something pops up or comes to your head.

#### Why do you do it?
- To train your attention and avoid distractions. Also, to avoid overlooking anything potentially important and to free yourself from the stress of having loose ends to constantly remember.
- Capturing does not mean interrupting what you are doing to do something else.
- It just means reacting to something that comes to your mind and writing it down, without spending more time on it at that moment, so that you can continue with what you are currently focusing on without being distracted by anything else.
- The purpose of capturing is to make sure that everything you need is out of your head and accessible.

#### Concepts
- Falling off the board
	- The expression “falling off the board” is often used in GTD to identify a situation in which, despite our best intentions to establish the necessary habits for good personal management, the day to day has overcome us and we have gradually abandoned the good practices we had begun to implement.
	- This is going to happen to you, just as it has happened to all of us. And not once, but several times. The important thing is to be aware that it is happening, get back on the board and continue surfing. Over time, it will happen less and less.
- The mind sweep
	- If you are just starting to use GTD, or you have fallen off the board, or you still have not fully acquired the habit of capturing, the “mind sweep” is an especially useful technique that you can use every time you have the feeling that there are still things outside your organizational system.
	- It simply consists of physically and mentally reviewing a list of personal and professional related categories and capturing everything that comes to mind about each of those items. Here is a detailed list of those categories.
	- Use Trigger List: https://facilethings.com/gtd-dictionary/en/incompletion-trigger-list

#### Best Practices
- A good practice is to capture 100% of your incomplete inputs, even those that seem unimportant, so that your organizational system represents an accurate picture of your real commit-ments and interests. If your system does not match your reality, your motivation will soon wane.
- Another good practice is to have as few capture trays as possible. It is about having access to them at any time and place to dump the ideas, but without scattering the information. If the inboxes are too scattered, it will be more difficult to process them in the next stage.
### Clarify
#### What is it?
- Turning previously captured stuff into self-evident statements.
#### How do you do it? 
- By clearly defining those inputs and deciding what, if anything, you are going to do with them.
- You will need to ask yourself a series of questions in relation to each one of the captures. Their answers will help you determine the shape and magnitude of what you have in hand; in other words, they will give you the information you need to be able to work on it properly.
- Clarifying is an iterative process in which you think about each of your captures, ask yourself a series of questions about them, and organize the results, leaving the inboxes empty at the end of the process.
- ==For each capture, the sequence of questions is as follows:==
	- What is it? Check for [[SMART ToDos]] and [[DoD - Definition of Done]]
	- Is it actionable? Does it require any action?
		- > Something is actionable when you can do something about it, and you want to or should do it
	- If it is not actionable, what are you going to do with it?
		- **Trash**. It is something you are not going to do or have any interest in, so you trash it. It has no value.
		- **Reference**. It is information that may be useful. You file it away as reference material. Resources/Archives in PARA. It is Interesting Information.
		- **Incubate**. It is not something you want to do as soon as possible, but you might want to
		  do in the future. You incubate it. I will clarify it later.
	- If it is actionable, what is the next visible and physical activity that you can do to move this thing forward? What are you going to do with it?
		- What is the next action? Once you have decided what the next action is you have three options:
		- **Do it.** --> Done in 2 Minutes
		- **Delegate it**. --> Someone else will do it.
		- **Postpone it**. --> I will do it
	- If it requires more than one step, what is the desired outcome or project
		- Whether an activity is considered as a single action or is divided into several actions will depend, among other things, on one’s personal proficiency in the task in question and the way one manages it.
			- For example, filing your income tax return may be a one-time action if your return is so simple that you only need to accept the draft that the IRS sends you or, even if it is not so simple, it is the same every year and you are already familiar with the process.
			- If you are not familiar with the process or your return includes many types of returns and considerations, you may need to define a project.
#### Prompts
- What is the desired outcome or result for each item in your inbox?
- Can the task be completed in two minutes or less? If so, do it immediately.
- Can the task be delegated to someone else? If yes, assign it and track its progress.
- If the task requires multiple steps, what is the next specific action needed to move it forward?
- Are there any tasks or commitments that are no longer relevant or necessary? Can they be deleted?
#### When do you do it?
- On a regular basis, depending on your activity level, and at least once a day.
#### What for?
- To identify your commitments and decide what to do with them, so you can get them under control and out of your head.

#### Concepts
- Open Loop: 
	- Anything that does not belong where it is, the way it is, is an "Open Loop", which will occupy unnecessary attention than in mental space than it deserves. This creates stress in our mind.
	- GTD is Getting Things Done without stress. Close Open Loops. 

#### Best Practices
- Two-minute Rule considerations
	- David Allen suggests immediately executing any action that will take you less than two minutes during the Clarify stage. This two-minute rule can be enormously powerful, but its apparent simplicity carries some risks.
	- The logic behind this rule is that, in certain cases, the execution of a given action takes less time than its clarification, organization and follow-up, making the inherent processing of the GTD methodology unnecessary.
	- If you take this suggestion too lightly, you may corrupt the constituent core of the GTD workflow, in which each stage is linked to a specific mental work mode. If you apply this rule “for everything” you will break the natural workflow, as you will constantly alternate between the “analytical mode” required by the Clarifying stage and an “executive mode” proper to the Engaging stage.
	- In addition, David Allen warns us that the “two minutes” is a guideline figure that can be expanded, which is sometimes misinterpreted as “do it on the spot if you have time”.
	- Of course, there are specific cases in which this formula can be beneficial. As David Allen himself points out in his book, email management often requires quick actions that can be done immediately, thus freeing up a considerable amount of work (immediate responses such as “thank you” or “ok, let us meet on Friday” should not be postponed).
	- General recommendation is to apply the “two-minute rule” only in cases where it will not interrupt the Clarifying process and does not jeopardize the emptying of the inbox, and if it does, it is preferable to postpone it, even in the case of actions that require little time.

### Organize
#### What is it?
- Putting everything in the right place in your organizational system.
#### How do you do it?
- By moving each already clarified element to the corresponding organizational category according to its nature and including the necessary information to maximize its usefulness.
- You need to create a reminder for each thing you consider incomplete in your world and, depending on the nature and characteristics of the reminder, keep it in the appropriate category, whose implementation will often be a simple list.
- ==Categories==
	- Project List
		- The Project List contains all the results you have committed to but have not yet completed.
	- The Calendar
		- Store next actions you need to do at a particular time or day. Your calendar will contain three types of things:
			- Actions you need to do at a certain time (appointments). Use Reminders in Things 3
			- Actions you need to do on a particular day, at any time of day. Use Today View and Anytime View.
			- Information related to a specific day. In this case it is not about actions you need to do, but information that can be useful to you on a certain date (e.g., when something is overdue or when it should be started, given a deadline). Use Start Date and Deadline in Things 3.
	- Next Actions list
		- Now, what about all those actions that you must do, but do not have a fixed date? These actions usually make up a much larger group (approximately 90% of your total actions) and will therefore also require a series of criteria for their organization.
		- The main criteria we will use in this case will be the contexts. In GTD we call contexts to the possibilities and constraints you have according to the environment in which you are physically located. Some actions can be done anywhere, but most of them require a specific place and/or tools available, that is, a specific context. You should group the Next Actions in different lists, one for each context you need to define.
	- Someday Lis
		- In the Someday/Maybe list you will incubate all those things that you cannot or do not contemplate intervening on now, either because you are not sure if they are relevant at present or because they are events projected to an uncertain future for which you cannot commit yourself yet.
		- This explains why Projects Action items should be marked as someday. Only Near future (1-2 week) Action Items should be marked as Anytime.
	- Agendas
		- Agendas contain reminders of actions that require other people. Agendas are just other Next Actions lists in which the limiting context is a person or a group of people. 
		- They are a great tool to reliably keep track of all the things you need to discuss with people or teams you meet regularly, so that the next time you can talk to them you can keep track of all the pending issues, without forgetting anything.
	- Waiting For List
		- All your delegated actions, which are waiting for the appropriate person or institution to carry them out, will go to the Waiting For list.
	- Archive
		- Here you will deposit items that have intrinsic value as information that may be of use or interest. The archive is usually divided into two sections:
			- Reference material, for information of rare use that you do not need to have nearby.
			- Support material, for more frequently used information, related to your ongoing projects, that you need to have more at hand.
	- Trash Bin
		- The Trash Bin, where you will discard captures that have no potential value to you.
#### Prompts
- Categorize tasks based on context (e.g., home, work, errands) or project.
- Create a "Next Actions" list that contains specific, actionable tasks that can be completed immediately.
- Identify tasks that are dependent on others and create a "Waiting For" list to track them.
- If a task requires multiple steps or has a deadline, create a project list to keep track of progress.
#### When do you do it?
- At first, you do it when you clarify.
- Then, any time the status of an already organized element has changed.
#### Why do you do it?
- To achieve a cohesive system that allows effective tracking of your visible items. When you know where everything is, your cognitive load is reduced and that allows you to perform better.
#### Concepts
- Contexts in GTD
	- Are contexts relevant in today's world where everything is connected.?
		- The reason that I assign contexts are to create what scientists call Implementation Intentions. Commonly known as **[Action Triggers](https://spacemakers.com.au//?p=1053)**.
			- Action Triggers are a complex form of planning that powerfully unlocks future behaviour. They are formed by clearly defining ‘where and when’ a future task will be done. According to the science, by visualising ‘where and when’, our brain creates a neural image of the desired event, which then triggers a desired action when the future situation or circumstance arises.
			- Where and when. Sound familiar?
			- This is exactly the type of scenario created when adding a context to an action/to-do. By adding @phone and a scheduled date, a future image of calling Jane on a Monday morning is created in your brain. This increases the likelihood of that action occurring. When Monday 9am ticks by, you automatically reach for your iPhone to enact the action pre-empted by your brain.
	- What is a Context? My Understanding.
		- According to David Allen, a context can be a place (I.e. @hardware store), a person (I.e. @agenda with Tom) or a productivity tool (I.e. @phone or @mac). They provide a way of assigning detail to an action/to-do to further define where and/or how a task will get done.
		- A context defines what you need to be able to carry out an action, and it can be a place, a tool or a person.
		- Contexts are a way of [modern prioritization](https://facilethings.com/blog/en/modern-prioritization.html) and provide the necessary flexibility so that you can adapt your activity to increasingly changing circumstances. They allow you to prioritize dynamically when the tools and people at your disposal vary.
		- The context must always be an objective criterion. It’s not about defining the situation in which you would *like or want* to do something but rather the situation in which you *have* to do it.
			- If you have a desktop computer and laptop at home you mustn’t use the *home* context for a task that you can do with both computers. Instead you should use the *computer* context which will allow you to bear in mind that task when you are working with your laptop at a coffee shop.
	- How to use Context?
		- When do you assign the context to the action? Always in the moment of processing.
		- When do you use the contexts? Only in the Next Action’s list.
			- Their purpose is to limit the list of possible next actions to a manageable number (ideally, around 10 when you combine contexts with your energy and time available) so you can easily decide what are you going to do now. They are not necessary in the Calendar, since the actions here are mandatory. If you’re not in the correct context, obligatorily you’ll have to go to it to do whatever you have in the Calendar. They are not necessary in the Waiting For list either, since they are actions that will be done by someone else.
		- What happens if I work with very limited contexts?
			- There are people who think that using contexts is not very helpful since they always do their work under limited contexts. If you have to carry out the majority of your tasks in your computer, what’s the point of tagging them all with `#computer`? Well, in these cases you shouldn’t think of so generic contexts, those that are normally used as examples in all GTD texts (`#home`, `#office`, `#computer`, etc.).
			- Remember that a context responds to the question “what do I need in order to do this?”. If most of your tasks must be done with a computer, or under a unique context, you need to be more specific when defining your contexts so they can be useful. Surely, you use different tools for different kind of tasks and probably starting and setting up some of them takes time. Moreover, it’s possible that each tool or group of tools requires a specific mental disposition (writing, drawing, reading or thinking require different degrees of concentration). Any of these factors convert those tools into contexts.
- Calendar is not a Todo List
	- The three things mentioned are the ONLY things that should be on the calendar.
	- You should always avoid using the calendar as a to-do list of tasks you would like to accomplish on a particular day, as these will weaken the emphasis on what you have to do.
	- In addition, day-to-day unforeseen events change your work as you go along, so it is not effective to set non-mandatory tasks in advance. If you fail to meet your self-imposed obligations in anticipation of circumstances you do not know about, it will be demoralizing and create stress that is easy to avoid. See [[Zeigarnik effect]]
	- Next Actions lists are the right place to manage those non-obligatory actions according to the real possibilities of the day, promoting the dynamic management
	  of daily chores.
	- The calendar should be sacred territory: if you write something there it must be done that day or never (except for appointments that are cancelled or rescheduled).
- Items in the Someday/Maybe list
	- The Someday/Maybe list can contain items of different nature whose common denominator is potential interest for future treatment. It is the place to include both events set on specific dates that you might be interested in attending (e.g. going to a concert, exhibition, etc.), and things you would like to do if your circumstances allow it (e.g. signing up for a pottery course), as well as any material associated with an activity of your interest that you usually do (e.g. books to read, movies to watch, new recipes to cook...).
	- For the latter case, it may be interesting to generate sub-lists that you will only have to consult when you want to perform those specific activities, and not on a regular basis.
#### Best Practices

### Reflect
#### What is it?
- The periodical and complete review of your organizational system carefully considering its contents.
#### How do you do it?
- By reviewing all your lists and inventories of pending and ongoing issues and adding and discarding everything that is relevant; in other words, updating it according to the changes that occur in your day-to-day life.
- We can group the steps necessary to do the Weekly Review into three categories:
	- ==1. Gain clarity==: The Weekly Review begins by collecting and clarifying all the incomplete items.
		- **Capture all the inputs that are not yet in the system**: Gather the spare papers and materials, the electronic “inputs” still to be processed, and empty your head of the rest of the unfinished stuff.
		- **Clarify and Organize**: Clarify all these inputs and put them in their corresponding lists.
	- ==2. Get up to date==: Now is the time to eliminate outdated reminders from your system and update and complete your active lists:
	  collapsed:: true
		- **Review past calendar entries**: Review the calendar entries since the last Weekly Review for pending items and transfer that information into the active system. Capture anything that may require action or triggers an idea.
		- **Review future calendar dates**: Review calendar entries for the coming weeks to avoid surprises with short reaction time. If necessary, capture anything relevant to prepare for upcoming events.
		- **Review the Next Actions lists**: Delete completed actions and review the contexts and Agendas. Capture new stuff if necessary.
		- **Review the Waiting For list**: Record all delegated actions and eliminate from the list everything you have already received. Also, follow up on actions still in progress (check the status of a delegated issue, add an item you would like to discuss in an already scheduled appointment with someone, etc.).
		- **Review the Project list**: Evaluate the status of the projects one by one and make sure you have at least one ongoing next action for each of them. Take a look at all supporting materials related to ongoing projects that have interest and potential to trigger new actions.
	- ==3. Get creative==: Once you have updated your system and have a sharp vision of all you are doing, it is a suitable time to boost creative thinking. To do so:
		- **Review the Someday/Maybe list**: A project may have become more interesting and valuable; if so, activate it and move it to the project list. Remove any items that have lost relevance.
		- **Be creative and brave**: Is there a new idea you can capture and include in your system? Now that you have a clearer perspective of your life, it is a fun time to think of new things, have ideas, and create.
#### Prompts
- Set aside time daily, weekly, or monthly to review your lists and commitments.
- Are there any tasks that need to be reprioritized based on changing circumstances?
- Are there any new tasks or commitments that need to be captured and clarified?
- Review your "Waiting For" list and follow up on any pending items.
#### When do you do it?
- Once a week. Refer [[T3. The Daily Review]]
#### Why do you do it?
- Your life is not static and therefore your personal management system should not be either. As your reality changes, you will need to make changes to your system and notice the possibilities that these changes open or close; what new moves they enable and which ones they foreclose.
- It is strongly recommended that you review your entire system on a regular basis, to ensure that it is a faithful mirror of your reality.
- To keep your organizational system up to date and at peak performance, which will provide you with clarity, calm and creativity to progress in your personal and professional projects.
- The Weekly Review is especially important, and it is up to you to create good habits, establish the right environments and get the tools to help you support it.
- Once a week you will need to step away from your daily routine for a while; not to dis- connect, but to place yourself on a higher horizon from which to observe the whole of your projects and get up to date. Try to adjust this ritual practice to your circumstances (whatever they may be) to make the use of the system effective.
- You may not get the full benefit of the Weekly Review at first. When you do not have an actual complete system in place, there is no great reward in reviewing things. The more complete your system is, the more you trust it; and the more you trust it, the greater your motivation to maintain it. The Weekly Review is the passkey to keeping that pattern going, the key to successful workflow management.

### Engage
#### What is it
- Choosing the best next action to take from all your options. At any given time of the day, you will be carrying out an activity that falls into one of these three categories:
	- ==Doing predefined work.== That is, you are doing things that are on your action lists. Most of the time you will be in this state, as long as your system is complete and up to date, giving you the maximum support to manage your reality.
		- In case you are doing predefined work, it will only take you a few moments to choose which action to perform next.
			- **First check your Calendar - Today View in Things**: The calendar contains the set and unavoidable actions that you need to consider as a priority.
			- **Then look at your Next Actions lists**: It will be essential that you have your next actions grouped according to contexts, so that you can focus on the things you can do (for example, when you have a phone at hand, a good predisposition to talk on the phone and time to spare, you will review your @ phone context).
				- How will you choose which next action to take and feel comfortable with your choice? The ***Four Criteria Model*** will help you make these decisions.
				- These four criteria are the context in which you find yourself, the time available, your available energy and the relative priority of each task.
					- **Context**: The environment in which you find yourself at any given moment establishes limitations and possibilities. Some actions can be performed an- ywhere, but most require a specific place, the presence of someone, or access to specific tools. These are the first factors that delimit your decision about what you can do at any given time.
					- **Available time**: “When do you have to do something else?” Other activities close in time may limit your options. For example, if you have a meeting in 30 minutes, it is preferable to dedicate yourself to some action that requires less time and can be completed.
					- **Available energy**: “How much energy do you have?” Some actions require a lot of mental energy, some require physical strength, and some require truly little of both. It is often ineffective to engage in complex tasks when you do not have enough energy. Your mood and your state of mind also affect your attention and cognitive capacity, so it is not advisable to engage in a task if your disposi- tion does not match its demands.
					- **Relative priority**: Once you have filtered your next actions according to the above criteria, which of them will bring you the most benefit? Which one makes the most sense to do right now?
	- ==Unplanned work.== When you are doing things as they come up. Occasionally something urgent or something that requires your immediate attention may come up, but this should be a conscious decision on your part for the sake of effectiveness.
	- ==Defining your work.== You are clarifying the things you have recently captured to decide whether you are going to do something with them or not; and if you do, to define what is the next action to be taken. Doing the Weekly Review is also defining your work.
#### How do you do it?
- By identifying which action best fits the context and tools available to you and carrying it out.
#### Prompts
- Consult your "Next Actions" list and choose tasks based on your available time, energy, and context.
- Focus on completing the chosen task without distraction.
- If you encounter a task that takes less than two minutes, complete it immediately instead of adding it to a list.
- Regularly refer back to your organized lists to guide your actions and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.
#### When do you do it?
- Every time you decide to do things based on the predetermined work, both in your work and in your personal life.
#### Why do you do it?
- To move forward in all the life commitments you have engaged in, moving you closer towards your desired outcomes and feeling good about what you do and what you do not do.
- The main purpose of this workflow management process is to facilitate good deci- sion-making about what you are going to do at any given time, so that choosing the actions to take is as simple and satisfying as possible. The goal of all the above is that you feel good about what you are always doing.
#### Concepts
- Even if you have thoroughly applied GTD in your life, there are at least three dynamics in play that influence your best decision-making.
	- First, your limitations. Where are you, and with what tools at hand? How much time do you have until your next engagement? How much creative energy do you have to put into this potential action?
	- Second, your adaptability. Are you best doing something already defined on your list, acting on new inputs, or taking time to clarify and organize what has just shown up in your in-basket and inbox to ensure your inventory of work is current and complete?
	- And third, from an overall context, your life purpose. What are your core standards and principles, your goals and objectives, your areas of focus that need appropriate levels of engagement? What is your long-term vision of success? (See [[GTD - The 6 Horizons of Focus]])
#### Best Practices

> What most has my attention right now? What do I need to do, next, to get that off my mind? I do this because I have a very high standard for having a clear head— I want nothing on my mind except the object of my intended focus.
