# 📒 Summary + Notes
Refer: [[Guideline on Book Highlighting]]
Summarize each chapter in two to three sentences, making sure to include any major plot points or events that occur within that chapter. 

## ==Buddha can be found in everyday life==

Pirsing goes to great length to use motorcycle maintenance as an example for being fully immersed into the world. He wrote "Zen&The Art of .... " in the 60s, during the Vietnam war and the hippie revolution. A lot of the protestors saw nature loving pacifism as a reaction to the tech-focused future.

**Pirsing does not see a conflict between tech and nature. It's not a subject problem, but a quality problem. Technology is not the enemy. He could became awakened by caring for his bike just as a guru would meditate on the mountain.**


## ==Real knowledge is beyond reason==

When we go to college we think that rational investigation would lead to some axiomatic truth that could be the foundation of our life. Some look for the truth in sciences others in philosophy. But there is no such a thing. 

Pirsing proposes quality as an undefined, experiential attribute of reality. His quality is the Tao, the Zen substance or God. **Quality is more of a spiritual, esthetic notion that can only be experienced not thought.** A prior perception of goodness we are all born.

> Making an art out of your technological life is the way to solve the problem of technology...
Art is anything that you can do well. 
﻿Anything that you can do with Quality.
 - ROBERT PIRSING
