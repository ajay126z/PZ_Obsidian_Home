#### Meet Your Instructor

## Hi, I’m Tiago Forte

AUTHOR & CREATOR OF BUILDING A SECOND BRAIN  
‍  
I’ve spent more than 10 years researching, teaching, coaching, and personally experimenting with new ways of organizing our digital lives and improving our productivity.

‍**Creating a *system* for productivity was one of the most profoundly impactful things I ever did for myself.** It’s given me a deep reservoir of confidence that I can handle whatever life throws at me.

I realized that anything life demands is just information, which can be broken up into manageable pieces (for example, content to consume, tasks to complete, appointments to schedule).

I feed these pieces into digital tools that are so much better at keeping track of them than my own brain ever could be – especially since I became a dad and can’t hold anything in my mind for longer than a minute (parents will know what I’m talking about).

Projects that seem overwhelming at first (an unexpected tax bill, finding the right pre-school, launching a new product) are now approachable, so I can tackle each piece until I arrive at the outcome.

‍**The richness and variety of my life isn’t limited by my mental capacity – my system can handle anything!**
