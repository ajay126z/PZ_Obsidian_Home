# Notes

Building an agency is the fastest way to make money online. I built mine to $200,000 in 2 years. But most people don't know how to start. Here is how to start your $10,000/month agency:

1. The skill First, figure out what niche you are going to build an agency in. â€¢ SEO â€¢ Copywriting â€¢ Video editing â€¢ Content writing â€¢ Fitness training â€¢ Web development These skills generally pay very well.

2. The offer "But haven't we already decided what we offer?" Yes. But that's our service, not the offer. Offer is what we present. Use Alex Hormozi's grand slam offer equation to make yours.

Here is an example: Bad offer "I will do SEO for you" Great offer "I will double your web traffic using SEO in the next 45 days or I work for free until I do" Offer. Time limit. Guarantee. Perfect.

3. The leads If you don't have a big social presence - getting inbound leads is tough. Cold email is your best friend. Reach out to potential clients (that you really think you can help) Get them on a call. 10 emails a day. For 30 days. And you will have 5 clients at least.

They might very well pay you $2000/month Success!...right? NO The work doesn't end here. Its starts here. You can keep hustling for the rest of your life like this. Or evolve and get $10,000+/month clients instead. How? ðŸ¡£

4. The service Give your clients world-class service. â€¢ The main service â€¢ The Text support â€¢ The smooth functioning Be so good they can't stop themselves from giving you a referral. A happy client brings 5 more.

5. The case study Until now, you didn't have any results to show for. But after your initial clients, you do! Put those into your website. Build a solid case study. Trust is the best tool to convert viewers into customers.

6. The expansion Now what? Expand. Find and grow attribution sources that can get you leads and calls. A content flywheel will go a long way in that.

Remember, $10,000 is a very small number. 1 Client of $10,000/month 2 Clients of $5000/month 5 Clients of $2000/month It's that simple. It's a volume game.

TL;DR Building a $10,000/month agency 1. The skill 2. The offer 3. The leads 4. The service 5. The case study 6. The Expansion It's not that hard. Anybody can do it.
