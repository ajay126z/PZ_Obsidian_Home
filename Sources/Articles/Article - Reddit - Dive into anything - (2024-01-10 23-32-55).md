I really love Obsidian and I decided to switch to this tool some months ago. I love the idea to have everything on my PC and not on a third party server.

The only thing that I don't completely understand is how to organize and search my notes.

Somewhere I read that there is no reason to build a folder and subfolder structure simply because it is against the concept of "brain organization" and because Obsidian give you all the tools to find your notes thanks to links, tags, etc. So I started to add a tag to each note (ex: #noteTaking).

At this point, all my notes are tagged, I have everything in the same folder, but the problem arrived when notes counter begun to growth.

Search for notes is pretty hard for me because everything is in the same folder. Ok there is a search feature, but I don't find it very intuitive. Even the "chart view" isn't helpful. Sometimes you are searching for a note, but you don't remember the specific title, you simply want to search it in a list like the index of your notebook.

For this reason I thought to build an Index page where I can link all my notes dividing them by "topics". But it's hard to keep that page updated.

So how to fix this problem?
