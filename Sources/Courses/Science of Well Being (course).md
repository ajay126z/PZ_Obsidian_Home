## 2. Savoring
- Savoring is the act of stepping outside of an experience to acknowledge it and appreciate it.
### Savoring Tips
1. Live in the moment
	- Often we fail to be present and fully enjoy what we’re experiencing. Savoring fixes that.
2. Magnify pleasant activities
	- Savoring intensifies and lengthens the positive emotions that come with doing something you love.
3. Did you eat today?
	- If you had a meal today, then you had an opportunity to savor something.
4. What can you savor?
	- It might be hard to believe, but you experience pleasant activities every single day. Savor a nice shower, a delicious meal, a great walk outside, or any pleasant occurrence that happens during your day.
5. Don’t take things for granted
	- One way to boost savoring in to think about how lucky you are. If you are feeling particularly unlucky lately, really challenge yourself to think of silver linings.
6. Retroactive savoring
	- One study showed that playing back a happy memory for 8 minutes leads to a happiness boost that can last several weeks. Take several minutes to reflect on a happy memory of your own.
7. Take a picture, it’ll last longer
	- One way to enhance your savoring is take a photo, so your can remember it later. Take advantage of the photo feature when you are journaling.

## 3. Gratitude
- Gratitude is a positive emotional state in which one recognizes and appreciates what one has received in life.

### Gratitude Tips
1. Why Gratitude?
	- Research shows that taking time to experience gratitude can make you happier, and even healthier.
2. There’s nothing too small
	- Gratitude has no limitations.
3. Keep it short and sweet
	- You don’t have to spend too much time writing in your gratitude journal - just 5 minutes will do. Take 5-10 minutes each day to write down 5 things you’re thankful for. Use Logseq.
4. Gratitude has long term benefits
	- Research shows that people experience a significant increase in happiness right after they deliver a gratitude letter - and, that increase in happiness stick around for more than a month!

6. Imagine that..

## 4. Kindness
- A random act of kindness is a selfless and unexpected gesture that really helps or impacts another person.

### Kindness Tips
1. The Kindness factor
	- Research comparing happy people to unhappy people shows that the difference between the two isn’t their salary or marital status, but rather how many simple acts of kindness they perform.
2. Think Kind thoughts
	- Did you know that even just thinking about something kind you did will boost your mood? So, take a moment now to think of that last nice thing you did for someone else.
3. Plan ahead
	- Plan out some acts of kindness. Can you help your colleague with something or donate to a charity? How about give a special shout out to someone who has been overlooked or write a simple thank you note? A little planning can go a long way.
4. Start small
	- Kindness doesn’t need to be over-the-top or time-intensive, even the smallest gesture can have a positive impact on someone else.
5. Treat yourself? May be not..
	- Research shows that there is truth to the statement: it is better to give than to receive. In a study instructing participants to spend $5 on themselves or $5 on someone else, those that spent the money on others felt much happier that those that spent it on themselves.
6. Bigger isn’t better
	- Even if money it tight, gifts do not need to be expensive. Research shows that spending $20 dollars gives you the same happiness boost as spending just $5. The amount doesn’t matter that much - it’s just the act of doing something kind.
7. Go to a kindness spree
	- Studies shows that doing several random acts of kindness in one day will significantly boost happiness. Try to step it up today and complete several acts of kindness.

## 9. Time Affluence
Time famine, a term that first emerged in the scientific literature around 1999, refers to **the universal feeling of having too much to do but not enough time to deal with those demands**.
The time famine can create personal stress and ineffectiveness at work, studies show that developing the opposite mindset of time affluence—**the feeling you don't have to make time and that there's always room for the important things**—raises personal happiness, mental and physical health and workplace performance.

	- In order to reap the benefits of time affluence, you have to avoid worrying about the opportunity cost of it.
