## What is Zeigarnik Effect
- Named after Lithuanian-Soviet psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik, in psychology the Zeigarnik effect occurs when an activity that has been interrupted may be more readily recalled.
- It postulates that people remember unfinished or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.
- Russian psychologist [Bluma Zeigarnik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluma_Zeigarnik) was perhaps the first to note the brain’s obsession with pressing tasks. The so-called “Zeigarnik effect” – that we remember things we need to do better than things we’ve done – stemmed from observing that waiters could only recall diners’ orders before they had been served. After the dishes had been delivered, their memories simply erased who’d had the steak and who’d had the soup. The deed was done and the brain was ready to let go.
- The Zeigarnik Effect refers to our tendency to remember incomplete or interrupted tasks better than completed ones. At first glance the Zeigarnik Effect can seem like a handy adaptation: It’s good to remember the things we need to do, and it’s a positive thing to want to finish the things we start.
## Effect of Zeigarnik Effect on Productivity
### The problem when it comes to our productivity is two-fold:
- First, **each incomplete task your brain reminds you about takes up a bit of your attention, splitting your focus and making it harder to concentrate on whatever you’re currently working on**. One [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21688924/) found that people who were interrupted during a task performed worse on a subsequent task than those who were allowed to complete the first task before starting the second one.
- Second, **even if we manage to physically disconnect from work, the Zeigarnik Effect ensures that our unfinished tasks follow us home. They intrude on our family dinners, our vacations, our weekends, and our sleep. There will always be work left to do.** We need a way to find relief from the Zeigarnik Effect so we can mentally disconnect in our hours away from work.
### What you can do about it:
- The good news is you don’t have to actually complete all of your tasks in order to feel mental relief from the Zeigarnik Effect. [Research shows](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/10/the-psychology-of-the-to-do-list-why-your-brain-loves-ordered-tasks) that simply **making a plan to finish your incomplete tasks can snooze your brain’s automatic reminders**.
	- More recently, [a study by professors Baumeister and Masicampo](http://users.wfu.edu/masicaej/MasicampoBaumeister2011JPSP.pdf) from Wake Forest University showed that, *while tasks we haven’t done distract us, just making a plan to get them done can free us from this anxiety.* The pair observed that people underperform on a task when they are unable to finish a warm-up activity that would usually precede it. However, when participants were allowed to make and note down concrete plans to finish the warm-up activity, performance on the next task substantially improved. As Bechman notes: “Simply writing the tasks down will make you more effective.”
- **Write your tasks down**. Your brain is a terrible filing system. Instead of keeping tasks in your head, make a habit of writing them down as soon as they come to you. Keep a digital task manager like  [[$Things3]] on your computer and phone, so you’ll always have it handy to jot down a new to-do.
- **Have a system for organizing and regularly reviewing your tasks**. Your system won’t work if your brain doesn’t trust that it’s accurate and up-to-date. Create rituals for planning your day and week so your brain can trust you’re working on the right things at the right time and can worry about everything else later.
- **Have an [end of work shutdown ritual](https://tdinspiration.wpengine.com/end-work-day/)**. Make a plan for tomorrow before you end the work day so your unfinished tasks don’t linger in your mind after-hours.
- **Find a small way to just get started**. The Zeigarnik Effect can also be used to our advantage. When you find yourself putting off a particularly big or difficult task, identify a very small first step you can take. The simple act of starting can trigger your brain to want to keep going to the end.
- **Don’t forget to look back at how far you’ve come**. Another negative side effect of the Zeigarnik Effect is that we quickly forget everything we’ve already accomplished. Don’t forget to look back at your completed tasks during a weekly review to celebrate what you’ve already
- **Tasks should be more actionable and smart.** to avoid Zeigarnik effect. Otherwise unfinished list will create stress.
	- It’s not enough to scrawl “bank” or “Mum” on a Post-it note, says Allen – you need more detail. Is it an email, a visit or a phone call, and for what purpose? If your to-do list isn’t clear and to the point, your tasks probably won’t get done – and they certainly won’t be prioritised.
	- Detail isn’t the only important factor, however: you also need to be realistic about how long things will take if you want to construct a workable timetable for the day. That means factoring in the potential for floating off onto social media or other distractions if you know you’re susceptible.
	- One trap people fall into is to consistently avoid tackling the larger, more major projects. The best way to overcome this is to break them down into much smaller, achievable blocks. “Write my novel” is a pretty foreboding task; “outline first chapter of my novel” is far friendlier and stands a chance of getting done.
